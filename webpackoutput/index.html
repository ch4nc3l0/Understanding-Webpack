Just because Webpack is installed doesn't mean it knows what we want it to do, we have to set a couple of configurations up before it will start. The first of them is adding the start script to "scripts" in package.json:</p><b>package.json</b> <textarea class=form-control rows=4 readonly=readonly style="background-color: #0b161d; color: white;">

Webpack is now installed & working in a very basic form! Now we can configure it to get more features.</p></div><div class="container mt-4"><h2>Basic Configuration</h2></div><div class=container><p class=lead>Before adding a dev, and production config for webpack, we will just make a config file that pretty much does the same thing webpack does by default, and then build on top of that. We will make a file called webpack.config.js, you can call it whatever you would like to but remember the name. I will always refer to the filename as webpack.config.js.</p><p class=lead>Inside of webpack.config.js we have to use some foreign-looking syntax. We have to first export a module and then define our configurations. Here I just defined the entry point (the file webpack will use to build our javascript) as the same file webpack automatically looks for by default.</p><b>Webpack.config.js</b> <textarea class=form-control rows=4 readonly=readonly style="background-color: #0b161d; color: white;">

We need to specify the path so we require that from npm. path.resolve is just a fancy way of locating the folder on your computer. filename is the name of the output file.</p><b>Webpack.config.js</b> <textarea class=form-control rows=5 readonly=readonly style="background-color: #0b161d; color: white;">

      },
      </textarea><p class="lead mt-2">The last basic configuration option is the mode. Mode can be set to either production, or development.

With loaders Webpack can understand more than just javascript. In this example I have been using a plugin for vscode to compile the Sass files to css files, lets use a loader to do this for us. On the terminal, using npm we have to install all the loaders we need.</p><kbd class=form-control style="background-color: #0b161d; color: white;">npm install sass-loader node-sass style-loader css-loader --save-dev</kbd><p class="lead mt-2">We have to install three loaders because the scss/sass loader depends on the other loaders. What is actually happening is our sass is being compiled to css using the sass-loader, then the css is compiled to javascript using the css-loader, and finally the css is applied to the dom directly using style-loader. In webpack config a module object has to be specified in order to use the loaders. Inside the module object there is a rule object that we can use test: on to test for filetypes like .css, .sass, and many more. After we specify what filetype to look for we have to tell webpack what we want to do with them using use:</p><b>Webpack.config.js</b> <textarea class=form-control rows=9 readonly=readonly style="background-color: #0b161d; color: white;">

Normally this is a good thing, but for development it can be a headache. Sometimes changes won't show on your computer when your editing css, worst case when you push the updated content a users' computer could just not update because the filenames are the same, even though the content is different.
